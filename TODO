nearest future:
-> make partclone-nbd a real server (daemonize, syslog, etc.)
-> add support for new version of partclone images

later:
-> add crc support
-> POSIX compatibility (the ability tu run partclone-nbd on FreeBSD, MacOS X, etc.)

distant future:
-> different endianness support
-> write support
